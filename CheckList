1. Useless Code Related Patterns
2. Loop Related Patterns
3. You can pack as many state variables in one slot as long as it fits 32 bytes(each storage slot is 32 bytes in size).
4. Using unchecked
5. Use calldata instead of memory for function parameters
  — Calldata is read-only
  — Memory when you need to modify or store data within the function
6. Pack & Hash Struct:
7. Short-circuiting
8. Uint8 is not always cheaper than uint256
9. Use bytes32 rather than string/bytes.
10. Make fewer external calls.
11. Events are cheaper to store data but you should look out for cost
12. Using fewer functions can be helpful
13. Calling internal functions is cheaper
14. Using proxy patterns for mass deployment
15. Merkle proofs for reduced storage load
16. Time of Deployment and init function
